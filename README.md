## About

Findit is a search app that finds posts on reddit. You can sort the results several ways as well as set the post actuality and limit the number of posts displayed.

Each post has a title, a preview of the description, a thumbnail and a button which redirects to the full post. Furthermore, the post score and date, the number of comments, and the subreddit's name are displayed too. By clicking on the subreddit badge, the subreddit's page opens in a new tab. There is a spoiler badge that appears only when a post contains spoilers. You can find a "Visit reddit" button on the right side of the header.

The whole website was made in reddit style (tab title, colors, etc.) and it is mobile friendly.

The website is hosted by Heroku. [Check here!](https://findit-search.herokuapp.com/)
